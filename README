This is a small hobby project that I made. I use python scripts which call bash commands to have 4 windows (which are currently still hardcoded) moved to specific places when `window_and_user_mover.py` is called (which I personally do on a trackpad command). This pops the user to the (currently, can be changed in the program) second workspace and positions the 4 (could be more or less) windows in (the hardprogrammed) position. This is very much a hoby project and I will (most likely) not release this, but if you want to fork it and use it yourself feel free :-D
